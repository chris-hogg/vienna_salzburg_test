# Vienna Salzburg
Example story showing a change in capital between Vienna and Salzburg.
It is very simple at the moment - not much can change by the user except the prompt.
The second line of buttons has better animations but is not dynamically created.
### Instructions
Open it and run with serve.bat (on windows).
## Questions
- shall i continue to develop this?
- shall i make it into the world map?
- it would be nice if i could implement it with mapmap, but is this possible?
- would i need to create a database to save it?


## For the future
- Implement it so that it runs automatically. 
- MAKE THE CODE TIDIER! (ignore turning it into modules at the moment I just want this to be clear and extensible. In particular look at the TODO section in the js.
- For the future (i.e saving), all you have to do is create a database of multiple sceneObjectArray.
- Do this not just for Austria, but for other countries too. Next- focus on a world map.
- See if this fits in with any other js libraries (i.e adding the map via mapmap and not d3.... hmmm, may work if I can get hold of the ids of the SVGs).
- Try and add proper data to it (i.e turning it into a chrloropleth map).
- shall i make the example better or see how I can make a world map from it?
- Make a world map (or any other maps from natural earth or the other website I saw).
